## My Past Projects
### Futher Web Progamming ([![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-black?style=flat&logo=react)], [![Nodejs](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Nodejs-green?style=flat&logo=Node.js)], [![Express](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Express-black?style=flat&logo=express)], [![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MySQL-black?style=flat&logo=mysql)])
https://github.com/rmit-fwp-s2-2021/s3544232_A2

The purpose of this application was to allow students to communicate in a safe place, only other students could contribute to a post.

### Programming IOT ([![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-black?style=flat&logo=python)][![Flask](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Flask-black?style=flat&logo=flask)][![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MySQL-black?style=flat&logo=mysql)])
https://github.com/Auzzzz/PIoT-Assignment-2

Programming IOT Assignment was to complete a car booking system that connects with a local device located within the car along with a sever/website allowing people to book the car all services where hosted locally on a raspberry pi. As seen in the repo this is broken up into 3 sections MySQL, MasterPi & AgentPi

- MySQL:
    - remote storage for both Pi's to connect to keeping track of users, cars, trips & bookings

- MasterPi
    - This hosted the connection with the MySQL database in the cloud along with connections to the AgentPi’s using sockets. This Pi also hosted the web server allowing bookings to be made through a Flask website & API 

- AgentPi
    - AgentPi's where located in 'the cars' these connected through sockets to the master pi to do all functions including logging in, starting the booking, ending the booking & using facial recognition using the built in camera. 


### Blockchain =0, Hyperledger
https://github.com/Auzzzz/Hyperledger_Fabric-for-Security-In-Comp--RMIT-
https://github.com/Auzzzz/Security_BlockChain

- For security in computing, we where required to write or make a block chain application. The blockchain application has two ‘chains’ the fictional government & housing authority. To keep track of buying and selling houses.
